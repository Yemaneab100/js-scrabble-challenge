Here are the steps needed to accomplish the task. 

1.  I will declare an abject that stores each letter by assigning a the given value called letterValues.
2. declare a variable that stores the sum of each letter in a word called total.
3.  using map function split the variable, and using conditinals statment, I will compute each letter a value from the letterValues object. When each letter is compared with each letter in the clause it will be uppercase and will return a number. For example, if the letter in the word is 'a' it will return 1.
4.  return total by adding each value to the total variable.
